# Rogue Minesweeper

A browser-based roguelike twist on the classic Minesweeper game. Navigate progressively larger minefields, collect gold, and buy upgrades to push deeper each run.

## Features

- **Progressive difficulty** – grid size and mine density grow with each level, challenging your deduction skills.
- **Shields as health** – survive multiple mistakes with regenerating and temporary shields.
- **Gold economy** – earn gold from safe tiles and level completion to spend on upgrades and items.
- **Permanent upgrade shop** – invest end-of-run gold on long-term upgrades like extra shields or starting gold.
- **Inter-level item shop** – purchase temporary buffs between levels from a rarity-based item pool.
- **Inventory & highscores** – track permanent upgrades, active buffs, highest level reached and max gold earned.
- **Flag cycle** – right-click tiles to cycle between flag, question mark and blank states.
- **Responsive design** – Tailwind CSS and custom fonts provide a retro sci-fi feel.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USER/rogue-minesweeper.git
   cd rogue-minesweeper
   ```
2. **Start a static web server** (from the project root)
   ```bash
   npx serve
   # or
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. **Open the game**
   Navigate to the served URL and load `public/index.html` (e.g. <http://localhost:3000/public/>).

> Opening the file directly may work, but using a web server avoids browser restrictions on ES module imports.
