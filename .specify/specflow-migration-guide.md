### If Coming From v1.0
- [ ] Create ROADMAP.md with phase overview (see template)
- [ ] Set up memory/constitution.md with project principles
- [ ] Archive any specifications/ content to .specify/memory/

### If Coming From v2.0
- [ ] Review any remaining /speckit references not auto-converted
- [ ] Update any custom scripts that reference speckit CLI
- [ ] Check .specify/templates/ for customizations to preserve

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `specflow status` shows correct project state
- [ ] `specflow check` passes all gates
